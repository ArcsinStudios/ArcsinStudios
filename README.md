# Hello, we're Arcsin Studios
## What we do
We're an Indie Game Studio.  
We make lots of fun things: RPG, Platformer, etc..

You can call us "Arcsin Studios", "arcsin" or just simply "asin" for short. I know that's a function in <math.h>.  
***But plz don't call us "sin<sup>-1</sup>"!!!!***
## Our games
As of now, we haven't *officially* released any games, but we've made some mini-games by Scratch, and we'll put them in our repo too.

We're now working on a new project. No spoilers in this README.
